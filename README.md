# Shopping List React App

[Demo](https://nike-shopping-ab2fb.web.app/).

I developed a mini shopping list website with React-Router Context Api.
 You can examine the products and add them to your cart. The products you put in the basket are registered at localalstorege and will not be lost when you refresh the page
